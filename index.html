        <h3>Date Range: May 2023 - August 2023</h3>

        <h2>About NCR</h2>
        <p>
            NCR Corporation is a large global enterprise technology company that specializes in software and hardware
            services that facilitate transactions for a very large range of sectors: primarily banking but also
            hospitality, retail, and telecommunications. Some of their products include automated teller machines
            (ATMs), self-checkout kiosks, POS systems, interactive teller machines (ITMs), and more. An area of computer
            science NCR relates to is cybersecurity, as cybersecurity principles like secure user authentication methods
            are essential due to their products handling financial transactions and personal user data. NCR Corporation
            has over 34,000 people working across 180 countries worldwide, their headquarters is in Atlanta, Georgia,
            and I worked at the Waterloo office.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I had three primary learning outcomes for this work term: enhance my proficiency in React and JavaScript to tackle more complex software development tasks, develop teamwork skills and contribute effectively to collaborative projects, and improve my oral communication abilities, specifically during meetings like stand-ups and sprint planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goals were closely related to my job tasks. For instance, my first goal was to improve my knowledge and skills in React and JavaScript, which I used daily at work. My second and third goals were aimed at improving soft skills, such as teamwork and communication, that were crucial in collaborative tasks and meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The skills I'm focusing on have both immediate and long-term benefits for my career as learning React and JavaScript will make me more versatile and valuable as a software developer, teamwork skills will enhance my ability to collaborate on projects, which is essential in any professional setting, and improved oral communication skills will help me articulate my ideas more clearly, contributing to project planning and effective problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe I achieved my goals related to improving my communication and teamwork skills. My team played a huge role in this success, as my colleagues and I practised communication and collaboration that allowed me to become better at and refine these skills regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also achieved my technical goal of becoming more proficient in React and JavaScript. The hands-on work and complex tasks I was assigned provided me with the ability to learn and apply these technologies effectively. However, while I have made significant progress in React and JavaScript, I believe there is still much more to learn to become truly proficient, and I look forward to continuing my journey in mastering them.
        </p>

    
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            <p>
                During my work term at NCR, I was primarily responsible for developing and maintaining two platforms: the TellerUI App (as seen below) and D3 Digital Banking platform. Both of these platforms are integral to streamlining financial transactions in the banking sector and enhancing user experience. For this job, a strong understanding of React and Node.js was crucial, while also using code quality tools like Wallaby, WhiteSource and SonarQube. While some foundational skills were learned during my academic courses, the hands-on experience at the job greatly accelerated my learning and proficiency.

            <p>
                One of the tickets I worked on focused on handling return media messages when cancelling a transaction in the TellerUI App. The goal was to ensure that cash was returned to the customer safely, and that the transaction could be effectively canceled. This involved various steps, such as displaying return cash processing messages and a final confirmation message.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are examples of some of the return media messages I created:

            <img src="media2.png" alt="A photo of media message" style="width:300px;" />
            <p>
                Another significant task was to ensure unit test coverage for certain components in the itm-components package, specifically RemoteHome and RemotePanel. This involved writing tests to cover new functionalities and ensuring the existing code was up to standard.
            </p>

             <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            My co-op work term at NCR has been a valuable experience, providing me with useful both technical and soft skills. From enhancing my knowledge in React and Node.js to improving my teamwork and communication abilities, this term has been pivotal for my professional development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I had the opportunity to work on meaningful projects, such as the TellerUI App and the D3 Digital Banking platform, which have broad impacts on financial transactions and user experience in the banking sector. Through these projects, I also gained practical experience in code quality analysis using tools like Wallaby, WhiteSource, and SonarQube.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this provided insight into a comprehensive overview of my growth and contributions during my co-op term at NCR. It highlights not just the technical skills I've learned, but also the soft skills I've gained, making me a well-rounded employee in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to give a big thank you to my colleagues Damien Dorobek and Ilija Milisav for mentoring me throughout this term and providing me help and assistance to grow and learn as a developer.
